The amount that Mohan will receive at the age of 26 will be x(1.04)^3 and the amount that Sohan will receive at the age of 26 will be (5100 - x)(1.04)^3. Since they should receive equal amount, we can set up the equation x(1.04)^3 = (5100 - x)(1.04)^3. Solving this equation, we get x = 2500. So Mohan's share is 2500.The answer is (B)."
